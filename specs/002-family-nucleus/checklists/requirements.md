# Specification Quality Checklist: Family Nucleus, Invitations & Sign-In

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Defaults chosen without asking (documented in Assumptions): sign-in optional
  (anonymous local-only mode preserved), one nucleus per user, flat membership
  (no roles), single-use 7-day revocable invitation links (no system-sent
  e-mail), task scope fixed at creation.
- The spec deliberately names no provider; adopting a backend is a
  constitution-amendment concern handled before planning.
